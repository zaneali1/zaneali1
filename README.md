Hello Reader!

I am Zane Ali, a graduate in BSc. (Hons) Physics with Computer Science from the University of Birmingham and an aspiring Software Engineer.
I have project experience in object-oriented programming, numerical analysis and signal processing; some of which you will see in this Github profile
(please bear with me as I commit all my projects in the upcoming weeks). 
My technical strengths include Java, Matlab, SQL and LaTeX and I have strong quantitative skills from the Physics in my degree. 

I have interned with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, a social entrepeneurship and a university technology transfer hub,
preparing me for any project-management or client-facing elements of a graduate role. 

You can find more details on my experience https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaneali1/ and you can contact me on  zxa507@alumni.bham.ac.uk.

Thank you for visiting!

Zane Ali
